Modular performance suite for shared hosting with caching, asset tuning, WebP conversion, database cleanup, and safe debug tools.

== Description ==

FP Performance Suite delivers a modular control center for WordPress administrators on shared hosting. It combines page caching, browser cache headers, asset optimization, WebP conversion, database cleanup, debug toggles, realtime log viewing, and hosting-specific presets behind a unified dashboard with safety guards.

= Features =

* Filesystem page cache with instant purge controls.
* Browser cache headers manager with automatic `.htaccess` updates when available.
* Asset optimizer for minification, script deferral, DNS prefetch, preload rules, and heartbeat throttling.
* WebP converter supporting GD and Imagick with lossy/lossless profiles and coverage reporting.
* Advanced database optimizer with health score, fragmentation analysis, missing indexes detection, MyISAM to InnoDB conversion, charset optimization, plugin-specific cleanup (WooCommerce, Elementor, Yoast), trend reports, and automated snapshots.
* Debug toggler with wp-config backups and realtime log viewer with filtering.
* Preset bundles tailored for common shared hosting providers and a technical performance scorecard.
* Import/export of configuration, multisite-aware options, and accessibility-minded confirmations.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `fp-performance-suite` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/` or install the ZIP via the WordPress dashboard.
2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.
3. Visit **FP Performance** in the admin menu to configure caching, optimization, and other modules.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the plugin work on managed or shared hosting? =
Yes. The suite is built to respect shared hosting limits and does not require external services.

= Do I need Imagick to convert images to WebP? =
No. The converter supports both Imagick and GD. If Imagick is unavailable it will fall back to GD automatically.

= Will it modify my `wp-config.php` or `.htaccess`? =
Only when you enable features that require it. Every change is safeguarded with timestamped backups and clear confirmations.
